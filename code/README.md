"The Paper" = [An Introduction to Counterfactual Regret Minimization](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf)

- `condensed.py` is the final `Flask API` hosted on pythonanywhere.com
- `main.py` is the local `Flask API` I used while developing
- `regret.py` is my attempt at Exercise 2.5 where I train two players against each other to reach equilibrium
- `regretAPI.py` is a version of Exercise 2.5 designed to give data series for a `Charts.js` line graph
- `regretHardCode.py` is a Python version of the paper's worked example for Rock Paper Scissors
- `regretRPS.ipynb` is a notebook I used to guide my understanding of the worked example in the paper.
