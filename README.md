# Regret Minimization in Avatar

### 15-251: Great Theoretical Ideas of Computer Science

Hey there! My name is Len, and this is my submission for a class I was taking
in Fall 2020 commonly called "251". We got to choose a topic and do really whatever,
so I chose to explore the topic of algorithmic game theory. More specifically
Regret Minimization. Combined with the iconic rerelease of Avatar the Last Airbender onto
Netflix in 2020, I found inspiration to combine the two in this project.
